🚀 Deployment
Deploying the Invisio Copilot app is straightforward. Here’s the breakdown of the deployment setup:

Component	Platform	URL Example	Description
Frontend	Vercel	your-frontend.vercel.app	Hosts the React-based user interface for the chatbot.
Backend	Render	your-backend.onrender.com/api/chat	Flask-based backend that processes requests, integrates Groq API, and sends responses to the frontend.

To deploy it yourself, follow the steps below:

Frontend:

Clone the repository for the React app.

Set up environment variables for API key management.

Deploy the app to Vercel using their seamless deployment flow.

Backend:

Clone the repository for the Flask backend.

Set up the Flask server and integrate it with Groq API for AI-powered query processing.

Deploy the Flask app to Render (or your preferred cloud platform).
